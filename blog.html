                    <p>To be clear, I am betting against because I think everyone is underestimating 
                    how difficult fully autonomous driving really is. I am by no means against self 
                    driving vehicles in any way! I'd much rather spend my time in a vehicle reading, 
                    watching videos, or talking to my family and friends â€¦ anything, really, instead 
                    of driving. I also think fully autonomous vehicles are a fascinating, incredibly 
                    challenging computer science problem, and I want everyone reading this to take it 
                    as just that, a challenge. Prove me wrong! Make it happen by 2030, and I'll be 
                    popping champagne along with you and everyone else!</p>

                    <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet 
                    with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
                    data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing 
                    power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like 
                    Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

                    <p>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to 
                    learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting 
                    technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, 
                    it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. 
                    Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than 
                    one would expect.</p>

                    <p>Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention 
                    in processes, namely by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, 
                    and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines.</p>
